According to many human rights organizations Israel is an apartheid state:

They are also actively genocidal and published their plans for everyone to read:

Plan Dalet

https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/plan-dalet-for-war-of-independence-march-1948

“Disruption of food supply lines and other vital services such as water, electricity, etc.”

“3. Expected tactical methods:
* Attacks by the regular and semi-regular forces on settlements, using heavy infantry weapons, as well as field artillery, armored vehicles, and the air force.
* Air strikes against centers within our cities (especially Tel Aviv)
* Harassment operations carried out by small forces against transportation arteries and settlements to give the operations mentioned above direct or tactical support. These forces will also carry out sabotage operations against vital economic facilities and terrorist raids within cities.”


“4. Mounting operations against enemy population centers located inside or near our defensive system in order to prevent them from being used as bases by an active armed force. These operations can be divided into the following categories:
Destruction of villages (setting fire to, blowing up, and planting mines in the debris), especially those population centers which are difficult to control continuously.
Mounting search and control operations according to the following guidelines: encirclement of the village and conducting a search7 inside it. In the event of resistance, the. armed force must be destroyed and the population must be expelled outside the borders of the state.
The villages which are emptied in the manner described above must be included in the fixed defensive system and must be fortified as necessary”

The government is also run by a bunch of white supremacists who can’t even treat their fellow Jewish people as equals:

They were literally allies with apartheid South Africa:

Nelson Mandela & Desmond Tutu both saw them as a brutal apartheid state:
